Do that 3-4 times, just focusing on your breath. Inhale, exhale... feel the tension start to melt away.\nProgressive Muscle Relaxation: Start with your feet. Tense your toes for a second... then release. Move to your calves—tense them, hold for a sec, then relax. Work your way up: thighs, stomach, chest, shoulders, and even your face. Tense each muscle group for 3-5 seconds, then let go. You’re basically telling your body to chill out.\nVisualize Calm: Imagine you’re lying on a beach, the sun’s setting, the waves are rolling in... It’s quiet, peaceful, and you’re just there, vibing. Picture yourself sinking deeper into that relaxed state with every breath.\nFinal Breath: Take one more deep breath in, hold for a moment, and release.
